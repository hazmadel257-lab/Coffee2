Espresso (Italian: [eˈsprɛsso]) is a concentrated form of coffee produced by forcing hot water under high pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Originating in Italy, espresso has become one of the most popular coffee-brewing methods worldwide. It is characterized by its small serving size, typically 25–30 ml, and its distinctive layers: a dark body topped with a lighter-colored foam called "crema"
  </li>

  <li>
    Espresso machines use pressure to extract a highly concentrated coffee with a complex flavor profile in a short time, usually 25–30 seconds. The result is a beverage with a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids than regular drip coffee, giving espresso its characteristic body and intensity.While espresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, its typical serving size results in less caffeine per serving compared to larger drinks such as drip coffee
  </li>
  <li>
    Espresso serves as the base for other coffee drinks, including cappuccino, caffè latte, and americano. It can be made with various types of coffee beans and roast levels, allowing for a wide range of flavors and strengths, despite the widespread myth that it is made with dark-roast coffee beans.The quality of an espresso is influenced by factors such as the grind size, water temperature, pressure, and the barista's skill in tamping (packing and leveling) the coffee grounds.
  </li>
  <li>
    The cultural significance of espresso extends beyond its consumption, playing a central role in coffee shop culture and the third-wave coffee movement, which emphasizes artisanal production and high-quality beans

    <h3>Active ingredient</h3>

  <li>
    This drink contains a higher percentage of caffeine than most other drinks, as the usual cup of espresso is served in a size of 60 ml and contains 80-150 mg of caffeine and a cup of 240 ml contains 95-200 mg of caffeine, but due to the small size commonly used cup in which espresso is served compared to the cups in which other coffee drinks are served,
    The total amount of caffeine in a cup of espresso is less than the amount of caffeine in a single cup of Americano or freshly brewed coffee.
    Espresso is also served as a double espresso or doppio, meaning twice the amount, and is served in a large cup for coffee lovers. Professionals usually take it undiluted or without sugar, while others are offered brown sugar if they prefer it thinned, and some even add a few drops of almond flavoring.

    <h3>Types</h3>
</li>
<li>
    Many types of espresso are offered in different cafes, including cold espresso (Alfredo espresso), which is espresso that is prepared in advance and chilled, or to which ice cubes are added.
    It is then placed in a container with additional ice to cool, and is typically served in Southern Europe, with consumption increasing in the summer. The Alfredo cappuccino has also been served in Greek cafes since 1991, alongside the Alfredo espresso.
    There are also two types of espresso: the stronger, the ristretto, in which the coffee is ground finer, pressed harder, and uses slightly less water; and the milder, the lungo, in which the water is slightly more. Both can be served in double doses: Dopio Espresso ristretto and Dopio Espresso lungo.
