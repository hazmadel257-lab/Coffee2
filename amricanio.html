    Caffè americano (Italian: [kafˈfɛ ameriˈkaːno]; Portuguese and Spanish: café americano; lit. 'American coffee'), also known as americano or American, is an espresso shot with hot water at a 1:3 to 1:4 ratio, resulting in a drink that retains the complex flavors of espresso, but in a lighter way. Its strength varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. The name of the drink may also be written with Italian spelling and diacritics as "caffè americano", or Portuguese and Spanish spelling and diacritics as "café americano"

     <h3>Naming</h3>
  </li>
  <li>
Americano means "American" in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.Some assert the term entered the English from Italian in the 1970s.Caffè americano specifically is Italian for "American coffee".There is a popular belief that the name has its origins in World War II when American G.I.s in Italy diluted espresso with hot water to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed.However, the Oxford English Dictionary cites the term as a borrowing from Central American Spanish café americano, a derisive term for mild coffee, dating back to the middle of the 1950s. Its first use in English appeared in the Jamaican newspaper The Sunday Gleaner in 1964. The term caffè americano entered Italian later than the English or Spanish uses, perhaps as a borrowing from one of the two languages.The term has since been embraced without its original pejorative connotation as "weak coffee".
  </li><br>
  <li>
In Italy, caffè americano may mean either espresso with hot water or long-filtered coffee, but the latter is more precisely called caffè all'americana (lit. 'American-style coffee')
  </li><br>
  <li>
    Following increased tensions in 2025 between Canada and the United States, some cafés in Canada have begun re-branding the americano as "canadiano" on their menus. In proper Italian, the adjective formation is "canadese",whereas the Portuguese and Spanish term would be "canadense"

    <h3>Preparation</h3>

  </li>
  <li>
The drink consists of a single shot of espresso mixed with added water. Typically about 120 millilitres (4 imp fl oz; 4 US fl oz) – 180 millilitres (6 imp fl oz; 6 US fl oz) of hot water mixed with the espresso
  </li><br>
  <li>
Long black is an Australasian drink similar to the americano (in contrast to short black for espresso), with an emphasis being placed on the order of preparation, adding water to the cup first before pouring one or two espresso on top.
  </li><br>
  <li>
In the western U.S., Italiano sometimes refers to a short americano with equal amounts of espresso and water (lungo)
