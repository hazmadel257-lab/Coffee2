        A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso and steamed milk. It generally has a higher proportion of espresso to milk than a latte, and lacks the thick layer of foam in a cappuccino. While the origin of the flat white is unclear, café owners in both Australia and New Zealand claim its invention

    <h3>Description</h3>
</li>
<li>
    Anette Moldvaer states that a flat white consists of a double espresso (50 ml; 1.8 imp fl oz; 1.7 US fl oz) and about 130 ml (4.6 imp fl oz; 4.4 US fl oz) of steamed milk with a 5 mm (0.20 in) layer of microfoam.According to a survey of industry commentators, a flat white is a shorter drink with a thin layer of microfoam (hence the 'flat' in flat white), as opposed to the thick layer of foam on the top of a cappuccino.The beverage usually features a pattern (latte art) on the surface
</li>
<li>
    The way a flat white is made varies between regions and cafés. In Australia a flat white is usually served in a ceramic cup with a handle, often of a similar volume (200 ml; 7.0 imp fl oz; 6.8 US fl oz) to the glass in which a latte is served, but the flat white usually has less milk and microfoam.According to Tourism New Zealand, flat whites are more commonly served in a smaller cup (175 ml; 6.2 imp fl oz; 5.9 US fl oz). In both Australia and New Zealand, there is a generally accepted difference between lattes and flat whites in the ratio of milk to coffee and the consistency of the milk due to the amount of microfoam produced when the milk is heated
</li>
<li>
    A true flat white ought to have the same quantity of extracted coffee as any other beverage on the coffee menu (generally 30 ml; 1.1 imp fl oz) but because it is served in a smaller vessel (175 ml; 6.2 imp fl oz) it has stronger flavour than say a latte which is normally served in a 225 ml (7.9 imp fl oz) vessel and is subsequently milkier. The consistency of the milk is another point of difference between a flat white and a latte – a latte has a creamy, velvety layer of milk on the surface which can vary in depth depending on where you buy your coffee. A flat white has a thinner layer of the textured milk, ideally with a shinier surface.
