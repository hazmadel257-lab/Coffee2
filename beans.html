  <div>   <P style="margin-left:20px;float:right; ">Coffee production is a significant contributor to the economy of Kenya.[1] The industry is noted for its cooperative system of production, processing, milling, marketing, and auction system. About 70% of Kenyan coffee is produced in small farms that control about 75% of the land under production.[2][3] It was estimated in 2012 that there were about 150,000 coffee farmers in Kenya.[4] Other sources suggest that 6 million Kenyans are employed directly or indirectly in the coffee industry.[5]
The acidic soil in the highlands of central Kenya together with just the right amount of sunlight and rainfall provide excellent conditions for growing coffee plants. However, due to a property boom in areas that grow coffee and price instability,[6][4] production in this African Great Lakes country fell from about 130,000 tonnes in 1987/8 to 40,000 tonnes in 2011/12.[7]
Kenya largely produces Arabica blend coffee.[8] Coffee from Kenya is of the 'Colombia mild' type, and is well known for its intense flavor, full body, and pleasant aroma with notes of cocoa, high grade coffee from Kenya is one of the most sought-after coffees in the world.[4]</P></div>

  <div>   <P style="margin-left:20px;float:right; ">Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee or Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is a classification of coffee grown in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. The coffee was introduced to Jamaica in 1728.[1]
 Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is an Arabica coffee-bean variety called Typica,[2] which originated in southwestern Ethiopia.[3]
The best lots of Blue Mountain coffee are noted for their mild flavour and lack of bitterness. Over the past few decades, this coffee has developed a reputation that has made it one of the world's most expensive and sought-after coffees. Over 80% of all Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is exported to Japan.[4] In addition to their use for brewed coffee, the beans are the flavour base of Tia Maria coffee liqueur.
Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is a globally protected certification mark, meaning only coffee certified by the Jamaica Commodities Regulatory Authority[5] (previously the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica) can be labelled as such. It comes from a recognised growing region in the Blue Mountain region of Jamaica, and the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica monitors its cultivation.
Generally located between Kingston to the south and Port Antonio to the north, the Blue Mountains are some of the highest mountains in the Caribbean, rising to 2,256 metres (7,402 ft). The region's climate is cool and misty with high rainfall, and the soil is rich with excellent drainage, conditions considered ideal for coffee cultivation</P></div>
