        <h3>History</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        Frappuccino is a portmanteau of "frappé" (pronounced /fræp/ and also spelled without the accent)—the New England name for a thick milkshake with ice cream, derived from the French word lait frappé (beaten milk)—and cappuccino, an espresso coffee with frothed milk
    </li>
    <li>
        The Frappuccino was originally developed, trademarked, and sold by George Howell's Eastern Massachusetts coffee shop chain the Coffee Connection, and created and named by his marketing director, Andrew Frank.When Starbucks purchased the Coffee Connection in 1994, they gained the rights to use, make, market, and sell the Frappuccino drink.The drink, with a different recipe, was introduced under the Starbucks name in 1995. In 2012, Starbucks had annual Frappuccino sales of over $2 billion

            Recipe
        </h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        The recipe is derived from a fusion of various cold drinks, including the "coffee frap" (similar to iced coffee)[dubious – discuss] and the "frappe" (blended ice cream, syrup, and milk), with the Italian cappuccino.The recipe consists of an instant coffee mix, ice, an emulsifying agent such as xanthan gum,and other additives such as milk, sugar, flavored syrups, and whipped cream']
